# RPLED

This project is tested on a raspberry pi pico W and is built on circuit python. For the WIFI setup it uses the settings.toml as described here: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-octoprint-controller-and-monitor/create-your-settings-toml-file. You need to specify CIRCUITPY_WIFI_SSID and CIRCUITPY_WIFI_PASSWORD settings.

## Dependencies
You need to add to following libraries to the lib folder:
- adafruit_httpserver
- neopixel

You can search and add them separately or use this page and pick them from the available Adafruit bundles: https://circuitpython.org/libraries.
